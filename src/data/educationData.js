  story: `
I used to work as an accountant and I often observed many students,
including myself, facing difficulties in using accounting software applications after graduation. As a result,
I decided to combine my knowledge in accounting with software engineering to bridge the gap between the two fields.
I developed a program that simplifies accounting concepts and helps students take their first steps in the field.
This experience inspired me to shift my career towards software engineering,
which is where my true passion lies.
